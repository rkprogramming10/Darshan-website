    Etymology :- <br>
    The name, Nashik, derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Nāsikā’ which literally means ‘Nose’.<br>
    As per Ramayana, Nashik is the location on the banks of Godavari river where Laxman, by the wish of Lord Rama, cut the
    nose of demoness Shurpanakha and thus this city was named as "Nashik".[16] It is also known by the name
    Panchavati.[citation needed]

Geography:-

The river Godavari originates from the Brahmagiri Mountain, Trimbakeshwar about 24 km (15 mi) from Nashik and flows
through the old residential settlement, now in the central part of the city. Due to high pollution created by factories
in proximity of the city the river was dying at an alarming rate. It has since been successfully cleaned.[19]

Nashik lies on the western edge of the Deccan Plateau which is an ancient volcanic formation.
<br>Trimbakeshwar is about 30 km (19 mi) from the city, it is where from river Godavari originates. The land area of the
city is about 259.13 km2 (100.05 sq mi).<br>
