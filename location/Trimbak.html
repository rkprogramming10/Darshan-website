The Simhastha Kumbh Mela in the Nashik district was originally held at Trimbak, but after 1789 clash between
Vaishnavites and Saivites over precedence of bathing, the Maratha Peshwa shifted the Vaishnavites' bathing place to
Ramkund in Nashik city.[2] The Shaivites continue to regard Trimbak as the proper location of the Mela.[3]

Brahmadev worshipped God Trivikram when he came to Satya Loka (on earth) with the same holy water of the Ganges, to get
the river Ganges held up by God Shankar on his head, to flow. River Ganges in the form of a woman was enjoying with Lord
Shiva, which was noticed by Lord Shiva's wife Parvati. She planned to drive Ganges away from her husband.
<br>
Parvati and her son Ganesh came to live in Gautama's Ashram with Parvati's friend Jaya. There was a famine of 24 years
and people were affected by the pangs of hunger. However, Varun - the God of Rains, pleased with Sage Gautama arranged
rains every day in Gautama's Ashram (dwelling place) which was in Trimbakeshwar. Gautama used to sow rice in the
surrounding fields of his Ashram in the morning, reap the crop in the afternoon and with it fed a large group of Rishis,
who took shelter in his Ashram on account of the famine. The blessings of the group of rishis increased the merit
(Punya) of Gautama. Lord Indra's position became shaky because of his increased merit. So Indra ordered clouds to rain
all over Trimbakeshwar, so that the famine will be over and Rishis will go back and the increasing merits of Gautama
will be weakened. Although the famine was over, Gautama urged the Rishis to stay back and kept on feeding them and
gaining merit. Once he saw a cow grazing in the paddy field and he drove her away by throwing Darbha (sharp, pointed
grass). The slender cow died by this. It was Jaya - Parvati's friend, who had taken the form of a cow. This news upset
the Rishis and they refused to luncheon at his Ashram. Gautama requested Rishis to show a way out of this sin. He was
advised to approach Lord Shiva and request him to release Ganges and a bath in the Ganges would set him free of his
sins. Gautama then practiced penance by going to the peak of Brahmagiri. Lord Shankara was pleased by his worships and
gave him the Ganges. However, Ganges was not prepared to part with Lord Shiva, which irritated him. He made TandavNrutya
(dance) on the peak of Brahmagiri and dashed his jata there. Frightened by this action, Ganges appeared on Brahmagiri.
Later on Ganges appeared in the Trimbak Tirtha. Gautama praised her but she off and on appeared on the mountain at
various places and disappeared in anger. Gautama could not bathe in her waters. Ganges then appeared in Gangadwar,
Varaha-tirtha, Rama-Laxman tirtha, Ganga Sagar tirtha. Still Gautama could not bathe in her waters. The Gautama
surrounded the river with enchanted grass and put a vow to her. The flow stopped there and the tirtha thus came to be
called Kushavarta. It is from this Kushavarta that the river Godavari flows up to the sea. The sin of killing a cow by
Gautama was wiped off here.</p>
