    Igatpuri is surrounded by the highest peaks in Sahyadri i.e. Western Ghats, most of them are forts built in Satavahana
    dynasty. It's heavenly for trekkers and hikers, Most Indian (Hindi) movie outdoor scenes specially songs are shot in
    Igatpuri region. Igatpuri is a place of significance in terms of Vipassana meditation. The International Centre for
    Vipassana meditation called Dhammagiri, supposedly the largest Vipassana Center, is located here.[2][3] This region
    consists of those mountains which are accessed by trains going from Mumbai CST to Kasara and Igatpuri. Local trains only
    go up to Kasara, and don't climb the Thal Ghat from Kasara to Igatpuri. Hence to go to Igatpuri, one has to either take
    a long distance train or reach Kasara by a suburban train and then take a bus uphill.
